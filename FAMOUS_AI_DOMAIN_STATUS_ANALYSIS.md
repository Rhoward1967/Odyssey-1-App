# Famous AI Domain Status Analysis

## Current Situation in Famous AI Dashboard

**Two domains are listed:**
1. ✅ **ai-tools-advanced-1.deploypad.app** - WORKING
2. ❌ **odyssey-1.ai/** - NOT WORKING

## What This Means

The deploypad.app subdomain works because it's automatically configured by Famous AI's infrastructure. The custom domain odyssey-1.ai is not working because the DNS configuration needs to be completed.

## The Fix Required

**In GoDaddy DNS Management:**

1. Go to GoDaddy DNS Management for odyssey-1.ai
2. Find the A record for @ (root domain)
3. Update the Value to: **52.6.250.82**
4. Save the changes

## Why This Will Work

- Famous AI dashboard shows IP: 52.6.250.82
- This is the official IP for your project
- Once DNS propagates, odyssey-1.ai will point to the same content as ai-tools-advanced-1.deploypad.app

## Verification Steps

After making the DNS change:

```bash
# Check DNS propagation
nslookup odyssey-1.ai

# Should return: 52.6.250.82
```

## Timeline
- DNS changes: 1-24 hours to propagate
- Both domains will then show identical content
- Custom domain will be fully functional

The deploypad.app domain working confirms your project is deployed correctly - we just need DNS to point the custom domain to the right place.
