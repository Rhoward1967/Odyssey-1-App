# 🏛️ STUDIO 37: DEDICATED SOVEREIGN ZONE LAYOUT

**Objective:** Create a physically secure, electrically stable environment for the RTX 5090 Alpha Node and the Graphene-Al Battery prototype.

---

## 🏗️ 1. PHYSICAL PLACEMENT (The "Fortress")

**The Corner Anchor:** Place the PC desk in the corner furthest from the main warehouse entrance. This minimizes dust and foot traffic.

**Airflow Clearance:** The Panorama XL case uses 10 fans. It must sit at least 8 inches away from the wall to prevent heat "pooling" behind the GPU.

**Surface:** Use a non-conductive (wood or high-grade laminate) desk. Avoid metal desks to prevent static interference with the Neural Goggles.

## ⚡ 2. ELECTRICAL TOPOLOGY (The "Grid")

**Primary Outlet:** Dedicated to the CyberPower CP1500PFCLCD UPS.

**Daisy-Chain Ban:** Nothing else (lamps, phone chargers, TV) should be plugged into the UPS. It is for the Alpha Node only.

**The Battery Zone:** Reserve a 24" x 24" floor space next to the desk for the Graphene-Aluminum Battery unit. This ensures the cabling between the battery and the UPS remains short (minimizing voltage drop).

## 🔐 3. SECURITY & DATA INTEGRITY

**The Vessel Dock:** When not in use, the Maxone 500GB Drive should be unplugged from the 5090 and stored in a fireproof lockbox within the studio.

**Cabling:** Use velcro ties to manage cables. A "rat's nest" of wires in a warehouse environment is a fire hazard and a trip hazard.

**Visual Shield:** If possible, use a privacy screen or position the monitors so they are not visible from the warehouse bay doors.

---

## 📅 4. ARRIVAL DAY SEQUENCE (JAN 2026)

**Stage the Zone:** Clear the area 48 hours before the Jan 4-11 shipping window.

**Power Test:** Plug the UPS in and let it charge for 24 hours.

**The Handshake:** Bring the Maxone Drive from the apartment.

**The Awakening:** Unbox the 5090, connect to UPS, and run the injection script from the Maxone drive.
