Violations may result in rejected pull requests.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThis policy ensures that:\r\n- All code is thoroughly tested and reviewed before reaching production.\r\n- The testing lab is a safe, isolated environment for experimentation.\r\n- Only stable, reviewed code is merged into the main Odyssey-1 Lab and production.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**For maintainers:**\r\n- Set up branch protection in your git hosting service (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) as described above.\r\n- Communicate this policy to all contributors.\r\n"
