# Famous.ai Domain Configuration Fix

## Current Issue
- Project shows `ai-tools-advanced-1.deploypad.app` in dashboard
- Custom domain `odyssey-1.ai` is added but not being used as primary

## Famous.ai Platform Steps

### 1. Force Domain Priority
In your Famous.ai project settings:
1. Go to **Domains** section
2. Ensure `odyssey-1.ai/` is listed (âœ“ Done)
3. Click "Instructions" next to the domain
4. Look for "Set as Primary" or "Make Default" option
5. If available, set `odyssey-1.ai` as primary domain

### 2. Deployment Configuration
The platform may need to rebuild with domain priority:
1. Go to **General** settings
2. Make a small change (like updating description)
3. Save changes to trigger rebuild
4. This forces the platform to recognize domain priority

### 3. DNS Verification
Ensure your domain DNS is properly configured:
- Check that `odyssey-1.ai` points to the correct deployment
- Verify CNAME records are active
- Allow 24-48 hours for full propagation

### 4. Platform Cache Clear
Sometimes the platform caches the old domain:
1. Try accessing `https://odyssey-1.ai` directly
2. If it works, the issue is just dashboard display
3. Contact Famous.ai support if domain doesn't resolve

## Expected Behavior
After these steps, the dashboard should show `odyssey-1.ai` as the primary domain instead of the deploypad.app subdomain.

## Verification
Test both URLs:
- `https://odyssey-1.ai` (should work)
- `https://ai-tools-advanced-1.deploypad.app` (should redirect or work as backup)
