## 🛡️ LEGAL PROTECTIONS YOU NEED

**We'll generate custom NDA:**

```typescript
// NDA Generator (built into ODYSSEY-1)
const nda = await ndaGenerator.create({
  parties: [
    'Rickey Howard (Disclosing Party)',
    'Manufacturer X (Receiving Party)',
  ],
  term: '3 years',
  confidential_info:
    'Technical specifications, designs, source code for Odyssey 2.0',
  purpose: 'Evaluating potential manufacturing partnership',
});
```

**Cost: $0** (vs $500-$1,000 with lawyer)

### 2. Assignment Agreement

**When to use:**

- Transferring patent rights to a company you form
- Selling patent to another party
- Licensing to manufacturer

**Template provided**

### 3. Invention Notebook

**Start NOW:**

- Document every design decision
- Date and sign each entry
- Have witness sign (proves conception date)
- Critical if someone challenges your patent

### 4. Trademark for "ODYSSEY"

**After patent filed:**

- File trademark for "ODYSSEY" brand
- Protects name/logo
- Cost: $250-$350 per class
- Can self-file at USPTO.gov

## 💡 PRO TIPS TO SAVE MORE MONEY

### 1. File Provisional First, Add Later (CIP Strategy)

- Your Nov 7, 2025 provisional covers R.O.M.A.N. AI
- File utility as "Continuation-in-Part" (CIP)
- Adds Locus Ring + Neural Gesture
- Keeps original filing date for R.O.M.A.N.
- **Saves filing separate patent ($415 × 2 = $830 saved)**

### 2. Delay Hiring Attorney Until Office Action

- USPTO usually rejects first time
- Use free Office Action response to learn what examiner wants
- THEN hire attorney to respond ($1,500)
- **Saves $8,000 upfront drafting fee**

### 3. Request Deferred Examination

- Don't pay examination fee immediately
- Gives you 3 extra years before examination starts
- Time to raise money for attorney if needed
- **Saves $190 upfront**

### 4. File International (PCT) Only If Needed

- PCT application costs $50K+ for all countries
- Only file if you have customers overseas
- Can file up to 12 months after US filing
- **Saves $50,000 unless truly needed**

### 5. Use Patent Bar Association for Free Advice

- Many patent attorneys offer free 30-min consultation
- USPTO has free inventor assistance program
- SCORE mentors can review business plan
- **Saves $500-$1,000 in consultation fees**

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ Mistake 1: Missing Deadline

**Problem:** If you miss Nov 7, 2026, you LOSE priority date  
**Solution:** Set up auto-reminders (we'll build this!)

### ❌ Mistake 2: Filing Wrong Entity Size

**Problem:** Claiming micro when you're not = fraud  
**Solution:** Verify income < $203,900 last year

### ❌ Mistake 3: Poor Claims Drafting

**Problem:** Narrow claims = easy to design around  
**Solution:** Use our auto-generator + attorney review

### ❌ Mistake 4: Incomplete Drawings

**Problem:** USPTO rejects if drawings missing  
**Solution:** We auto-generate all required figures

### ❌ Mistake 5: Public Disclosure Before Filing

**Problem:** Showing Odyssey 2.0 publicly starts 1-year bar  
**Solution:** File first, THEN demo to public
