## 🚀 HOW TO USE IT

### Step 1: Generate Complete Filing Package

```bash
cd /d C:\Users\gener\Odyssey-1-App
npx tsx src/services/patentFilingPackage.ts
```

**Output:** `ODYSSEY_2_PATENT_APPLICATION_COMPLETE.docx`

### Step 2: Review Document

Open the Word document and review:

- Specification describes all 3 inventions clearly? ✓
- Claims cover Locus Ring, Lumen Core, Neural Gesture? ✓
- Drawings show all components with reference numbers? ✓
- Prior art section lists competitors and differences? ✓

### Step 3: Optional Attorney Review ($500-$1,500)

Send document to patent attorney for review:

- "I've drafted a complete utility patent application"
- "Please review for USPTO compliance and claim strength"
- "I'll file it myself, just need your expert feedback"

**This saves $8K-$15K** vs having them draft from scratch!

### Step 4: File on USPTO.gov

Follow the step-by-step guide in `SELF_FILE_PATENT_GUIDE.md`:

1. Create account at https://my.uspto.gov
2. Access EFS-Web at https://efs.uspto.gov
3. Upload specification, drawings, declarations
4. Pay $415 filing fee (credit card)
5. Submit application

**You'll receive confirmation within 24 hours!**

### Step 5: Track Deadline

```bash
npx tsx src/services/patentDeadlineTracker.ts
```

**Monitors 352 days remaining** and sends alerts!
