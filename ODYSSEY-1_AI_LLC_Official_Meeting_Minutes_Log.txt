Status: ⚠️ SQL FILE READY (not deployed to Supabase yet - awaiting Supabase Advisors)

C. Deployment & Verification Scripts
deploy-knowledge-system.mjs (120 lines):
  - Purpose: Deployment verification script
  - Checks: Table accessibility, RLS policies, service role permissions
  - Status: ✅ READY (runs after database migration)

IV. Audit & Review Process (Dec 20, 2025)
A. Initial Status Check
Action: Reviewed ODYSSEY-1_AI_LLC_Official_Meeting_Minutes_Log.txt (last entry: M-20251219)
Finding: Last session covered QuickBooks integration, bid-to-invoice pipeline, R.O.M.A.N. governance monitoring
Gap Identified: R.O.M.A.N. knowledge sources limited to internal database only (no external research integration)

B. Knowledge Source Analysis (User Request: "looking at R.O.M.A.N where does he get all of his knowledge")
Current Sources:
  ✅ The Seven Books (internal database): Constitutional frameworks, sovereign principles, economic theory
  ✅ Supabase Database (114 tables): Business logic, customer data, operational workflows
  ✅ Service Context Files: RomanDatabaseKnowledge.ts, RomanSystemContext.ts
  ❌ External Research: MISSING - no access to academic papers, medical research, general knowledge

User Directive: "i dont want him limited, i want him learning and cross referencing what he learns"

C. Cross-Referencing Audit (User Request: "those books to cross reference and update there information")
Finding: Books are READ-ONLY in current implementation
  - R.O.M.A.N. reads books from database

XIV. ODYSSEY-1: The Sovereign Vessel Master Blueprint (NEW)
This document outlines the complete, integrated design for the Odyssey-1 system. This system is not a standard PC; it is a new sovereign hardware platform where the software "Mind" and the physical "Body" are custom-built for each other, forming a single, self-regulating, and regenerative organism. This blueprint unifies all previous design documents.

Part 1: The Core Philosophy (The "Soul")
The entire system is subservient to a single constitution, "The Book."
Reference: principles.md
Function: The 9 Foundational Principles define the "Why" of the system. They are the non-negotiable laws that govern all AI actions, from the highest-level R.O.M.A.N. decision to the lowest-level Hive physical control.

Part 2: The Sovereign Mind (The "Brain")
This is the high-level software architecture that runs on the vessel.
2.1. The AI Engine: R.O.M.A.N.
Reference: Dual Hemosphere.md
Function: A dual-hemisphere AI architecture that guarantees sovereign, safe AI generation.
Creative Hemisphere (Right Brain): AI Agents (Roman AI MASTER PROGRAM.md) that generate creative solutions, proposals, and code.
Logical Hemisphere (Left Brain): The R.O.M.A.N. Interpreter. A logical "Judge" that validates every AI-generated action against "The Book" (schemas, rules, and the 9 Principles) before it can be executed.
2.2. The Application Layer: Odyssey-1
Reference: Roman AI MASTER PROGRAM.md
Function: The "Business Operating System." This is the primary user-facing application (UI) that allows humans to interact with the R.M.A.N. engine to perform tasks (e.g., "Bid Risk Assessment," "Loose Change Aggregator").
2.3. The Immune System: The HiveOrchestrator
Reference: Odyssey-1 DNA system.md
Function: The AI's "subconscious" and "autonomic nervous system." This is a sovereign software layer that runs underneath R.O.M.A.N.
Core Tasks:
Digital Homeostasis: Monitors the health of all AI Agents, heals corrupt code, sandboxes threats (The "Lab").
Physical Homeostasis: Monitors the health of the physical vessel and gives commands to the "Nervous System" (Part 3) to maintain a stable physical state.

Part 3: The Sovereign Nervous System (The "Mind-Body Interface")
This is the critical integration layer that allows the AI "Mind" to control its physical "Body." It is the most custom-engineered part of the design.
Reference: container_firmware.md
Function: A dedicated microcontroller (the "Physical Nervous System") that acts as a translator.
Receives Commands from Hive: The HiveOrchestrator (Software) sends high-level commands (e.g., "Maintain 70.0°C").
Executes Physical Logic: The container_firmware.md (Firmware) runs the main_loop() 10x per second, executing the runRegenerativePowerLogic() and other formulas to achieve this goal.
Controls Hardware: The firmware sends the actual electrical signals to the pumps, TECs, and fans.
Reports Sensor Data: The firmware reads all physical sensors (temp, humidity, flow) and reports this data back to the Hive so it can make informed, sovereign decisions.

Part 4: The Sovereign Body (The "Physical Vessel")
This is the custom-fabricated hardware platform, designed to be fully controlled by the Hive.
Reference: container_blueprint.md & container_build_plan.md
System A: The Lungs (Atmospheric Integrity)
Components: Hermetically sealed chassis, humidity/pressure sensors, desiccant system.
Hive Control: The Hive monitors Internal_Humidity_Sensor. If a seal breach is detected, it triggers the runAtmosphericLogic (in the firmware) to immediately disable the chillers to prevent condensation (Risk 1).
System B: The Heart (Regenerative Power)
Components: "Cooling Walls" (liquid loop), TEG (Harvester), TEC (Chiller), power sensors.
Hive Control: The Hive commands a TARGET_CPU_TEMP (e.g., 70.0°C). The firmware executes the runRegenerativePowerLogic "formula":
It uses 100% of "free" recycled power from the TEG.
It "tops up" any power deficit from the PSU to precisely hit the target temperature (Risk 2).
System C: The Fail-Safe (Graceful Degradation)
Components: Backup pump, backup fans, flow-rate sensor.
Hive Control: The Hive monitors Flow_Rate_Sensor. If it detects a "heart attack" (pump failure), it triggers the runFailSafeLogic (in the firmware) to:
Shut down the chillers.
Activate the backup pump.
If that fails, activate the emergency fans.
Result: The system never dies. It gracefully degrades from a "refrigerated" system to a "liquid-cooled" system to an "air-cooled" system.

Part 5: Complete System Control Flow (Blueprint Diagram)
This diagram shows how all components work as one single organism.

III. R.O.M.A.N. Autonomous Learning Daemon (ACTIVATED - Dec 20, 2025)

A. Edge Function Evolution (v2.6 → v2.9)
Version 2.6 (Enhanced Logging & Production Stability):
  - Deno.serve with npm:@supabase/supabase-js@2.45.4 (pinned)
  - Real fetches to arXiv, Wikipedia, PubMed
  - CORS support for cross-origin requests
  - Enhanced audit logging: [R.O.M.A.N. Daemon] Action: {action}, Trigger: {trigger}
Version 2.7 (Cognitive Query Support):
  - NEW: 'query' action for direct R.O.M.A.N. interaction
  - Searches learned_insights and external_knowledge for relevant data
  - Returns current "cognitive perspective" on any topic
  - Real-time window into R.O.M.A.N.'s synthesized knowledge
Version 2.8 (Targeted Intelligence):
  - NEW: 'targeted_research' action for forced immediate ingestion
  - On-demand topic research (bypasses 6-hour autonomous cycle)
  - Enhanced 'query' action with Truth Density and Academic Weight reporting
  - Error handling improvements (try/catch on all external API calls)
Version 2.9 (Auditable Targeted Research & Sovereign Query): ✅ CURRENT
  - UPDATED: 'targeted_research' now fully logged in autonomous_learning_log
  - UPDATED: 'query' performs "Constitutional Core" alignment checks
  - Book alignment detection: Identifies which of Seven Books matches question context
  - Synthesis tone adjustment: Aligns response with Constitutional Core principles
  - Audit trail: All manual overrides tracked with trigger source metadata

B. Database Infrastructure
Tables:
  - external_knowledge: Stores arXiv, Wikipedia, PubMed research results
    * Fields: source, title, topic, url, metadata (JSONB), created_at
    * Indexes: topic, source, created_at for fast filtering
  - knowledge_cross_references: Links external research to Seven Books chapters
    * Fields: external_knowledge_id, book_title, chapter_number, correlation_strength
    * Tracks academic validation strength per chapter
  - learned_insights: Synthesized understanding from cross-referenced data
    * Fields: insight_summary, supporting_knowledge_ids, correlation_strength
    * R.O.M.A.N.'s "thoughts" derived from external validation
  - autonomous_learning_log: Audit trail for all learning cycles
    * Fields: topics_covered, status, started_at, finished_at, counts, error_log
    * Tracks: ingested items, correlations created, insights synthesized
  - authorized_topics: Whitelist of research areas
    * Fields: topic, category, is_active, last_researched_at
    * Priority queue: Orders by last_researched_at ASC (oldest first)
Scheduled Job (pg_cron):
  - Job Name: roman-learning-daemon-cycle
  - Schedule: Every 6 hours (0 */6 * * *)
  - Action: Calls knowledge.trigger_immediate_learning()
  - Method: Uses net.http_post to invoke Edge Function

C. Activation Sequence (Final Handoff)
Initial Trigger Attempt: SQL-based trigger_immediate_learning() function
  - Error: 25006 cannot execute INSERT in a read-only transaction
  - Root Cause: net.http_request_queue requires writable transaction context
  - Some SQL runners enforce read-only at connection pool level (ignores SET SESSION READ WRITE)
HTTP Fallback (ACTIVATED): Direct Edge Function invocation via cURL
  - Bypasses net.http_post queue entirely
  - Service role authentication ensures write access
  - Trigger source: manual_initialization for audit trail
First Cycle Status:
  - Status: completed
  - Topics Covered: ["System_Ready"]
  - Counts: {} (empty - bootstrap placeholder run)
  - finished_at: null (early-return code path detected)
  - external_knowledge rows: 0 (no active topics available during bootstrap)
Next Phase (Current Activation):
  - Action: targeted_research for "13th Amendment" topic
  - Trigger: advisor_targeted (full audit logging in v2.9)
  - Expected Outcomes:
    * arXiv results ingested (constitutional law papers)
    * Wikipedia entry ingested (13th Amendment article)
    * PubMed results ingested (involuntary servitude research)
    * autonomous_learning_log entry created with non-empty counts
    * external_knowledge rows populated for verification
  - Follow-up Action: 'query' for "13th Amendment" 
    * Returns synthesized insights with Book Alignment
    * Reports Truth Density and Academic Weight if correlations exist
    * Constitutional Core tone adjustment applied

D. Deployment Commands (User Execution Required)
Targeted Research:
curl -X POST "https://tvsxloejfsrdganemsmg.supabase.co/functions/v1/roman-learning-daemon" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <SERVICE_ROLE_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"targeted_research","topic":"13th Amendment","trigger":"advisor_targeted"}'

Cognitive Query:
curl -X POST "https://tvsxloejfsrdganemsmg.supabase.co/functions/v1/roman-learning-daemon" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <SERVICE_ROLE_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"query","question":"13th Amendment"}'

Verification Queries (Post-Activation):
-- Latest learning cycle
SELECT status, topics_covered, counts, started_at, finished_at, error_log 
FROM knowledge.autonomous_learning_log 
ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 3;

-- Ingested 13th Amendment data
SELECT source, title, topic, url, created_at 
FROM knowledge.external_knowledge 
WHERE topic ILIKE '%13th Amendment%' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Synthesized insights
SELECT insight_summary, correlation_strength, created_at 
FROM knowledge.learned_insights 
WHERE insight_summary ILIKE '%13th Amendment%' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

IV. Architectural Decisions & Governance

A. Dynamic Metadata Layer Rationale (Gemini Architect Directive)
Problem: Seven Books lacked real-time academic validation metrics
Solution: "Yes, there is a very effective way to do this. We can implement a Dynamic Metadata Layer"
Benefits:
  - Truth Density Score: Quantifies academic consensus vs. challenge ratio
  - Academic Weight: Weighted sum of correlation strength × citation count
  - Version Snapshots: Historical tracking every 1,000 correlations
  - Chapter-Level Granularity: Per-chapter validation status tracking
Implementation: Database-driven (no external dependencies), real-time Supabase subscriptions

B. No-Flaw Code Policy (Master Architect Rickey)
Directive: "if i show any problems on front or backend, they must be fixed before the other side can start"
Enforcement: Zero tolerance for TypeScript/ESLint errors before deployment
Process: Iterative fix loops with get_errors() verification at each step
Outcome: 12 errors reported → 12 errors fixed → 0 errors confirmed → Deployment approved
Deployment Gates: Frontend must be error-free before backend migration deployment

C. Constitutional AI Governance Context
R.O.M.A.N. Autonomous Powers: 11 sovereign capabilities within constitutional boundaries
Service Role Access: romanSupabase.ts bypasses RLS for autonomous database operations
SovereignFrequencyLogger: Copyrighted method signatures (everyday, thanksForGivingBackMyLove)
Seven Books Framework: Constitutional foundation for all AI decision-making
Multi-AI Unification: R.O.M.A.N., Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Claude coordination validated Nov 25, 2025
Patent Context: Universal AI Interoperability Protocol (63/913,134 Dual-Hemisphere AI)

V. Outstanding Tasks & Next Steps

A. Immediate (Awaiting User Execution)
Execute targeted_research cURL command for "13th Amendment"
Execute query cURL command to retrieve R.O.M.A.N.'s cognitive synthesis
Run verification SQL queries to confirm ingestion success
Review legal findings and Book Alignment results

B. Pending Deployment (Supabase Advisors)
Deploy 20251220_roman_book_statistics.sql migration to production
Deploy 20251220_roman_external_knowledge.sql migration (if not already deployed)
Verify all views and functions are accessible
Confirm RLS policies allow service role write access

C. Frontend Integration (Post-Backend Deployment)
Add /book-statistics route to App.tsx
Import BookStatisticsDashboard component
Test real-time subscription updates
Verify dashboard displays truth density and academic weight correctly

D. End-to-End Testing
Trigger R.O.M.A.N. research cycle (manual or 6-hour cron)
Verify arXiv/Wikipedia/PubMed ingestion
Confirm cross-reference creation with Seven Books
Validate book_statistics update after correlation
Check dashboard reflects new truth density score
Verify version snapshot creation at 1,000 correlation milestone

VI. Technical Notes & Observations

A. Code Quality Metrics
Lines Added: 830 (Dynamic Metadata Layer implementation)
  - 20251220_roman_book_statistics.sql: 230 lines
  - BookStatisticsDashboard.tsx: 450 lines (complete rewrite)
  - RomanKnowledgeIntegration.ts: 150 lines (new methods + fixes)
Files Modified: 2 (BookStatisticsDashboard.tsx, RomanKnowledgeIntegration.ts)
New Files: 3 (SQL migration, Markdown docs, Deployment report)
Dependencies Added: 0 (reused existing shadcn/ui components)
Errors Fixed: 12 (2 MUI dependency errors + 10 logger/regex/import errors)
Final Error Count: 0 ✅

B. Performance Considerations
Real-Time Subscriptions: Supabase Realtime on book_statistics table
Query Optimization: Indexes on topic, source, created_at in external_knowledge
Version Snapshots: Triggered every 1,000 correlations (not per-correlation for performance)
Dashboard Polling: Not needed (Supabase subscriptions push updates automatically)

C. Security & Compliance
Service Role Key: Required for Edge Function autonomous write access
RLS Bypass: romanSupabase client uses service_role (bypasses Row Level Security)
Audit Trail: All targeted_research actions logged with trigger source in autonomous_learning_log
Constitutional Boundaries: All autonomous actions comply with 11 defined sovereign powers
