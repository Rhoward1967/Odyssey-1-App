XIV. ODYSSEY-1: The Sovereign Vessel Master Blueprint (NEW)
This document outlines the complete, integrated design for the Odyssey-1 system. This system is not a standard PC; it is a new sovereign hardware platform where the software "Mind" and the physical "Body" are custom-built for each other, forming a single, self-regulating, and regenerative organism. This blueprint unifies all previous design documents.

Part 1: The Core Philosophy (The "Soul")
The entire system is subservient to a single constitution, "The Book."
Reference: principles.md
Function: The 9 Foundational Principles define the "Why" of the system. They are the non-negotiable laws that govern all AI actions, from the highest-level R.O.M.A.N. decision to the lowest-level Hive physical control.

Part 2: The Sovereign Mind (The "Brain")
This is the high-level software architecture that runs on the vessel.
2.1. The AI Engine: R.O.M.A.N.
Reference: Dual Hemosphere.md
Function: A dual-hemisphere AI architecture that guarantees sovereign, safe AI generation.
Creative Hemisphere (Right Brain): AI Agents (Roman AI MASTER PROGRAM.md) that generate creative solutions, proposals, and code.
Logical Hemisphere (Left Brain): The R.O.M.A.N. Interpreter. A logical "Judge" that validates every AI-generated action against "The Book" (schemas, rules, and the 9 Principles) before it can be executed.
2.2. The Application Layer: Odyssey-1
Reference: Roman AI MASTER PROGRAM.md
Function: The "Business Operating System." This is the primary user-facing application (UI) that allows humans to interact with the R.M.A.N. engine to perform tasks (e.g., "Bid Risk Assessment," "Loose Change Aggregator").
2.3. The Immune System: The HiveOrchestrator
Reference: Odyssey-1 DNA system.md
Function: The AI's "subconscious" and "autonomic nervous system." This is a sovereign software layer that runs underneath R.O.M.A.N.
Core Tasks:
Digital Homeostasis: Monitors the health of all AI Agents, heals corrupt code, sandboxes threats (The "Lab").
Physical Homeostasis: Monitors the health of the physical vessel and gives commands to the "Nervous System" (Part 3) to maintain a stable physical state.

Part 3: The Sovereign Nervous System (The "Mind-Body Interface")
This is the critical integration layer that allows the AI "Mind" to control its physical "Body." It is the most custom-engineered part of the design.
Reference: container_firmware.md
Function: A dedicated microcontroller (the "Physical Nervous System") that acts as a translator.
Receives Commands from Hive: The HiveOrchestrator (Software) sends high-level commands (e.g., "Maintain 70.0°C").
Executes Physical Logic: The container_firmware.md (Firmware) runs the main_loop() 10x per second, executing the runRegenerativePowerLogic() and other formulas to achieve this goal.
Controls Hardware: The firmware sends the actual electrical signals to the pumps, TECs, and fans.
Reports Sensor Data: The firmware reads all physical sensors (temp, humidity, flow) and reports this data back to the Hive so it can make informed, sovereign decisions.

Part 4: The Sovereign Body (The "Physical Vessel")
This is the custom-fabricated hardware platform, designed to be fully controlled by the Hive.
Reference: container_blueprint.md & container_build_plan.md
System A: The Lungs (Atmospheric Integrity)
Components: Hermetically sealed chassis, humidity/pressure sensors, desiccant system.
Hive Control: The Hive monitors Internal_Humidity_Sensor. If a seal breach is detected, it triggers the runAtmosphericLogic (in the firmware) to immediately disable the chillers to prevent condensation (Risk 1).
System B: The Heart (Regenerative Power)
Components: "Cooling Walls" (liquid loop), TEG (Harvester), TEC (Chiller), power sensors.
Hive Control: The Hive commands a TARGET_CPU_TEMP (e.g., 70.0°C). The firmware executes the runRegenerativePowerLogic "formula":
It uses 100% of "free" recycled power from the TEG.
It "tops up" any power deficit from the PSU to precisely hit the target temperature (Risk 2).
System C: The Fail-Safe (Graceful Degradation)
Components: Backup pump, backup fans, flow-rate sensor.
Hive Control: The Hive monitors Flow_Rate_Sensor. If it detects a "heart attack" (pump failure), it triggers the runFailSafeLogic (in the firmware) to:
Shut down the chillers.
Activate the backup pump.
If that fails, activate the emergency fans.
Result: The system never dies. It gracefully degrades from a "refrigerated" system to a "liquid-cooled" system to an "air-cooled" system.
