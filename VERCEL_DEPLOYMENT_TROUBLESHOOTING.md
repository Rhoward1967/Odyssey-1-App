# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
Your Vercel project shows "Ready" status but GitHub pushes aren't triggering new deployments.

## Quick Diagnosis Steps

### 1. Check Vercel-GitHub Integration
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Git
2. Verify the repository is correctly connected to "Odyssey-1ai"
3. Check if there are any "Deploy Hooks" configured

### 2. Verify GitHub Repository Settings
1. Ensure the default branch is "main" (matches Vercel expectation)
2. Check that your commits are authored with the same email as your GitHub account
3. Run: `git config user.email` to verify

### 3. Check GitHub Actions
Your repo has auto-deploy workflows that might be interfering. Check:
1. GitHub → Actions tab to see if workflows are running
2. Look for any failed deployments

### 4. Manual Deployment Test
1. In Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
2. Click "Deploy" and select your latest commit
3. If this works, the issue is with automatic triggers

## Solutions to Try

### Option 1: Reconnect GitHub Integration
1. Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Git
2. Disconnect and reconnect your GitHub repository

### Option 2: Check Deploy Hooks
1. Vercel → Project Settings → Git → Deploy Hooks
2. If empty, create a new deploy hook
3. This will provide a webhook URL for manual triggers

### Option 3: Verify Environment Variables
Ensure these GitHub secrets are set:
- VERCEL_TOKEN
- VERCEL_ORG_ID  
- VERCEL_PROJECT_ID

### Option 4: Force Push
Try a force push to trigger deployment:
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force deployment trigger"
git push origin main
```

## Your Current Setup
- GitHub Repo: Odyssey-1ai
- Vercel Project: odyssey-1ai-jqed
- Domain: odyssey-1.ai
- Branch: main
- Status: Ready (but not auto-updating)
