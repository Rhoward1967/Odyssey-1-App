# IMMEDIATE DNS FIX - GoDaddy to Deploypad

## CURRENT PROBLEM
Your GoDaddy DNS is pointing to the WRONG IP address:
- Current: `A @ 52.6.250.82` ❌
- Should point to: `ai-tools-advanced-1.deploypad.app` ✅

## IMMEDIATE FIX STEPS

### 1. Login to GoDaddy DNS Management
- Go to GoDaddy.com → My Products → DNS
- Select odyssey-1.ai domain

### 2. DELETE Current A Record
```
DELETE: A @ 52.6.250.82
```

### 3. ADD Correct CNAME Record
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Value: ai-tools-advanced-1.deploypad.app
TTL: 1 Hour
```

### 4. ADD WWW CNAME Record
```
Type: CNAME  
Name: www
Value: ai-tools-advanced-1.deploypad.app
TTL: 1 Hour
```

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS
```bash
# Check DNS propagation (wait 5-10 minutes)
nslookup odyssey-1.ai
dig odyssey-1.ai CNAME

# Should show deploypad.app infrastructure
```

## TIMELINE
- DNS Change: Immediate in GoDaddy
- Propagation: 5-60 minutes globally
- SSL Generation: 10-30 minutes after propagation
- Site Live: Within 1 hour total

## IMPORTANT NOTES
- NEVER use A records with Deploypad hosting
- Always use CNAME records pointing to deploypad.app
- Famous.ai will auto-generate SSL once DNS is correct
- Keep TTL at 1 Hour for faster updates

## AFTER DNS FIX
1. Wait 10 minutes for propagation
2. Visit https://odyssey-1.ai (should work)
3. Check SSL certificate (should be valid)
4. Test all site functionality

Your site should be live within 30-60 minutes after making these DNS changes!
