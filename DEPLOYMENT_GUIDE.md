# GoDaddy Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Build Your Project Locally

1. Open terminal/command prompt in your project folder
2. Run these commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
3. This creates a `dist/` folder with your built website

## Step 2: Access GoDaddy File Manager

1. Log into your GoDaddy account
2. Go to "My Products" â†’ "Web Hosting"
3. Click "Manage" next to your hosting account
4. Click "File Manager" or "cPanel File Manager"

## Step 3: Upload Files

1. Navigate to `public_html` folder (this is your website root)
2. DELETE any existing files in public_html (like index.html, etc.)
3. Upload ALL contents from your `dist/` folder to public_html:
   - index.html
   - assets/ folder
   - robots.txt
   - Any other files in dist/

## Step 4: Configure Domain (if needed)

If using a custom domain:
1. In GoDaddy DNS settings, point your domain to your hosting
2. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

## Step 5: Test Your Site

Visit your domain - your React app should load!

## Troubleshooting

- If you see "Index of /" instead of your site, ensure index.html is in public_html root
- If CSS/JS doesn't load, check that assets/ folder uploaded correctly
- For routing issues, you may need to add .htaccess file for React Router
