ABSTRACT

A modular wireless computing system with continuous neural authentication comprises three integrated components: (1) a wearable ring device with neural sensors detecting sub-muscular nerve impulses for continuous biometric authentication and gesture control; (2) a modular cubic computer with 27 wirelessly-interconnected components powered by solar and thermoelectric energy; and (3) a holographic display projecting a volumetric interface. The ring monitors the user's unique neural signature, instantly locking the system when removed. Gestures are detected from nerve impulses before muscle movement occurs, providing sub-2ms latency. The modular architecture enables component hot-swapping and wireless power distribution at 95% efficiency. Applications include secure computing, accessible interfaces for paralyzed users, and cable-free modular workstations.
